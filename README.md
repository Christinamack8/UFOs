## Summary

Describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development:

One drawback of this design is "shape" is not very descriptive.  As you filter through the data and did not know what kind of shapes were present to choose from you might not be able to find the rest of the data.

Reccomendations would be to add gps coordinates for the exact location as well as being able to add a photo or video for further "proof."
